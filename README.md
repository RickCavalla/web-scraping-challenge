# Web Scraping Homework
#
# My Mission To Mars page was too big for one screenshot
# so there are 4 image files in git home directory, each
# a new screenshot as I scrolled down page
#
# mission_to_mars.ipynb = testing notebook for scraping
# app.py = flask app
# scrape_mars = function version of notebook code, which
#     does the scraping in flask app
